# Even or Odd
# 1. Write a program that asks the user for an integer and determines if it is even or odd.

def main(): 
    x = get_int()
    if x % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
        print("The number is even") 
    else:
        print("The number is odd")

# 2. Write a program that asks the user for an integer and determines if it is positive, negative, or zero.

def get_int():
    while True:  # Here, an infinite loop is used so the program keeps asking for a number until an integer is entered
        try:  # A try-except block is used to handle the exception if the user enters a non-integer value
            return int(input("Enter an integer: "))
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter an integer")
