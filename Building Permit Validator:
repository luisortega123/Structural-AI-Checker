# Building Permit Validator
# This program checks whether a construction project requires a special permit.

# Ask the user for the type of construction and convert it to lowercase
construction_type = input("Type of construction (residential/commercial): ").lower()

# Ask the user for the area in square meters and convert it to a float
square_meters = float(input("Square meters? "))

# Check if the construction area is 500 square meters or more
if square_meters >= 500:
    print("Requires special permit")  # If true, print that a special permit is required
else:
    print("Does not require a special permit")  # If false, print that no special permit is needed
